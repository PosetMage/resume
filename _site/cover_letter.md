Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the AI Engineer role. As a Founding Engineer with expertise in full-stack AI R&D, I bring a track record of delivering high-impact systems from zero to production.

In my current role as Senior AI Engineer at Infotech, I pioneered end-to-end AI systems for banking that achieved 70% efficiency gains in financial document processing. I serve as a technical decision-maker alongside PM and architects, translating ambiguous AI initiatives into concrete, low-risk deliverables aligned with operational workflows.

Previously as a Co-Founder and Founding Engineer, I led AI Agent product development that improved productivity by 10x. I built LangGraph-GUI, a zero-to-one AIGC workflow system with scalability and fault tolerance on NVIDIA GPU and cloud SaaS infrastructure.

My foundation in systems optimization comes from Qualcomm and HTC ViveVR, where I achieved a 75% runtime reduction in computer vision algorithms on mobile DSP and a 130% performance increase in VR rendering. These experiences shaped my ability to deliver performant solutions across the stack.

Technical highlights:
- AI/ML: Agentic AI, Prompt Engineering, LangGraph, MLOps, Computer Vision
- Backend: Python, Go, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, pgvector
- Infrastructure: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, CI/CD, Linux
- Systems: C++, SIMD, DSP optimization, GPU profiling

I thrive in fast-paced environments where I can take ownership and drive technical decisions. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience can contribute to your team.

Sincerely,
Sidney Lu (Chia-Hao)
